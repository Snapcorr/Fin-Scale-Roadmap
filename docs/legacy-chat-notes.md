> Extracted design principles, guidance and planning notes based on initial architecture sessions and prototyping efforts.

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Concepts

- **Project Codename:** Fin-Scale
- **Primary Objective:** AI-assisted portfolio management for microcap equities
- **Core Flow:** Filter â†’ Score â†’ Optimize â†’ Display
- **Philosophy:** 
  - No heavyweight frameworks
  - Focus on speed and modular clarity
  - Small, replaceable components

---

## âš™ Implementation Guidelines

- Every asset JSON must include:
  - `expected_return`
  - `risk`
  - `liquidity`
  - `sector`
- Risk scoring based on percentile bucketing
- Normalize all inputs before optimization
- Final output: list of asset weights (float percentages)

---

## ðŸ§  Future Ideas (From Initial Brainstorm)

- Add visual dashboards: pie, bar, radar charts
- Use Redis to cache optimization runs
- Allow saving session states
- Option for multi-timeframe optimization: daily / weekly
